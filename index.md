# Tuple's Pair Programming Guide (wip)

<p class="text-lg">Tips, tutorials, and resources for thoughtful pair programmers</p>

<div class="border-t-4 border-indigo-dark w-24 mt-4 mb-8"></div>

## The goal

To be a _comprehensive_ guide for thoughtful programmers who care about pairing well. 

If this guide isn't sufficiently awesome, or you need to go elsewhere for additional info, **that's a bug**. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/tupleapp/pair-programming-guide/issues/new) and let us know what we should add.  

## Where to start

<div class="hidden lg:block">
  Click something interesting in the sidebar over there &larr;.
</div>

<div class="sm:block lg:hidden">
  Click the hamburger up there &uarr; and find something interesting.
</div>
