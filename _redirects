# Why we need this:
#   1. Jekyll is rewriting requests to strip out the baseurl in dev, which is /pair-programming-guide
#   2. Jekyll actually doesn't serve our app in prod, so we have redirects in the *landing* instance replicate this stripping/rewriting
#   3. Accessing the guide instance directly requires the redirect below to match the landing instance behavior

/pair-programming-guide/* /:splat 200
