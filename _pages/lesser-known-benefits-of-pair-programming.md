### Coworkers interrupt less

There's something about two devs in conversation that discourages interruptions.

### Flow is easier to recover

If one of you is interrupted, the other can remain in a flow state, and quickly bring you back in.

### You'll be happier

If you're anything like me, it's hard to disentangle your mood from how much you got done at work.

When I pair, I get more done due to spending less time distracted or blocked. 

I finish the day tired but pleased.

### Your hands get a break

RSI is no joke. It can end careers.

Pairing lets you share the typing and put fewer miles on your tissues.
