Ready for some meta?

In this video, [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me/) and I paired on the HTML/CSS/design for this very site!

If you want to see how this site used to look (and how we improved it), you'll love this video.

You can also watch how Adam recommends using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework he co-created (and that I love).

Also seen: a sneak peek at an early prototype of [Tuple](https://tuple.app?utm_source=pairing-guide&utm_campaign=adam-ben-pairing-vid), a tool we're building to make remote pair programming snappy and pleasant.
