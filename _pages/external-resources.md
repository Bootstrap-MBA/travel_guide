We didn't write these guides, but you should read them anyway.

## [The Art of Agile Development: Pair Programming](https://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/pair_programming.html)

_by James Shore_ 

This article is worth reading if only for the 99-word summary of pairing at the top:

> It's more fun than it sounds: two programmers at one computer. One drives; the other navigates. Switching roles fluidly, they constantly communicate. Together, they accomplish better work more quickly than either could alone.
> 
> The driver types. She focuses on _tactics_--writing clean code that compiles and runs. The navigator focuses on _strategy_--how the code fits into the overall design, which tests will drive the code forward, and which refactorings will improve the entire codebase.
>
>Pairs self-organize by selecting partners who can best help with the current task. They switch every few hours to share perspectives and knowledge.

Beyond that, James' guide is packed full of quality advice, written with the voice of experience:

> When you start pairing, expect to feel clumsy and fumble-fingered as you
> drive. You may feel that your navigator sees ideas and problems much more
> quickly than you do. She does—navigators have more time to think than drivers
> do. The situation will reverse when you navigate. Pairing will feel natural
> in time.

> As navigator, help your driver be more productive. Think about what's going
> to happen next and be prepared with suggestions. When I'm navigating, I like
> to keep an index card in front of me. Rather than interrupting the driver
> when I think of an issue, I write my ideas on the index card and wait for a
> break in the action to bring them up. At the end of the pairing session, I
> tear up the card and throw it away.



## [How To Pair Program](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/how-to-pair-program-d6741077e513)

_by Jeff Dickey_

This post is worth reading because it's someone who started off skeptical of pairing, tried pairing with experienced devs, and discovered he really enjoyed the experience.

Jeff's post is full of practical advice from someone who's put the time in.

Some highlights:

> Don't expect just because you can program you can pair [&#8230;]
> 
> Try to do it each and every week. Don’t expect it to go swimmingly every
> time, but trust that once you and your team get the hang of it the edges will
> be roughed out.

> While you are pairing, the number one thing to keep in mind is “Is my pair
> engaged?” or “Am I engaged with my pair?” usually the person that’s driving
> will be more engaged, and switching it is one technique to help bring
> yourself or your pair back into the action.

> The goal of pairing is always to learn. Whether it’s to learn about the
> programming language, learn about the company, learn about your coworker,
> learn about the project, or learn how to pair in general, you should be
> learning something new the whole time.



## [Five Rules of Pair Programming Etiquette](https://blog.rapid7.com/2017/01/27/5-rules-of-pair-programming-etiquette/)

_by Rapid7_

Unlike the other links in this article which cover pairing broadly, this post focuses on etiquette during your pairing session.

The five rules:

> 1. Agree on the physical environment beforehand
> 1. When talking about code, always refer to line number and file name
> 1. When disagreeing, talk in terms of benefit
> 1. When feeling ill at ease, say so
> 1. Bestow as many compliments as possible

I find the first rule least compelling of the bunch, but the remainder are great.
