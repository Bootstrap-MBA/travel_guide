## [How To Pair Program](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/how-to-pair-program-d6741077e513)

This post is worth reading because it's someone who started off skeptical of pairing, got the chance to pair with experienced devs, and discovered he actually really enjoyed the experience.

Jeff's post is full of practical advice from someone who's put the time in.

Some highlights:

> Don't expect just because you can program you can pair [&#8230;]
> 
> Try to do it each and every week. Don’t expect it to go swimmingly every time, but trust that once you and your team get the hang of it the edges will be roughed out.

> Pairing is way more about communication than it is about who’s actually typing code.

> While you are pairing, the number one thing to keep in mind is “Is my pair engaged?” or “Am I engaged with my pair?” usually the person that’s driving will be more engaged, and switching it is one technique to help bring yourself or your pair back into the action.

> The goal of pairing is always to learn. Whether it’s to learn about the programming language, learn about the company, learn about your coworker, learn about the project, or learn how to pair in general, you should be learning something new the whole time.
