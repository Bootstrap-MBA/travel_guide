This remote pairing session took place between [Derrick Reimer](https://www.derrickreimer.com/) and me, [Ben Orenstein](http://www.benorenstein.com/).

In it, we work on Derrick's new app, [Level](https://level.app).

At the time, I had a small amount of Elm experience, and virtually none with Elixir, Phoenix, or GraphQL. 

I think this video does a nice job of demoing how to contribute as a navigator when you're less familiar with the code being worked on.

Sadly, this was recorded before [Tuple](https://tuple.app) was a thing, so we had to use Skype. This led to me dictating code at some points, which is a bit of an  [antipattern](/pair-programming-guide/antipatterns#giving-low-level-instructions).
