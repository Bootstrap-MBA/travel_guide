## Getting started

0. Install the deps: 

  run `yarn`.

1. Run postcss to compile tailwind:

  `yarn build`

2. Tell jekyll to serve the site:

  `jekyll serve`


## Deploying

The site is deployed automatically by Netlify when things are pushed to master.

It runs the above steps and then deploys.

Configure Netlify things here:
